# Topic Title

__Problem__: State your problem here (concisely)

__Actions__: Steps to take in order to solve the problem stated above. This can be in paragraph form, but the idea is not to write an essay, but rather a quick set of points to go from data to answer.

Bullets (Must have space between heading and bullets):

  * Step 1
  * Step 2

Ordered Lists (Must have space between header, same as bullets):

  1. Step 1
  2. Step 2
  3. Step 3


Pictures are added like this (be sure to add picture to images directory):

![watch](/images/watch.jpg)

Code samples should be formatted:

{% highlight python %}
# Python example
$ def foo():
...    print "Everyone is welcome to contribute!"

$ foo()
Everyone is welcome to contribute!
{% endhighlight %}


__Explanation (resolution)__:

Explain why your technique works, the interpretation and the business impact if possible. Again, brevity is key, no one wants to read 10000 word articles!
